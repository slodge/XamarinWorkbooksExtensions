Add the Slodge extensions package:

```csharp
#r "Slodge.XamarinWorkbookExtensions"
```

Create a list of `Thing`s

```csharp
class Thing
{
    public string Name {get;set;}
    public DateTime When {get;set;}
}

var list = new List<Thing>() {
    new Thing() { When = DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(-1), Name = "Yesterday" },
    new Thing() { When = DateTime.UtcNow.Date, Name = "Today" },
    new Thing() { When = DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(+1), Name = "Tomorrow" },
};
```

That was ugly - letâ€™s try it as a table:

```csharp
list.AsTable()
```
